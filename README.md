This project contains source codes used for simulations and calculations, the results of which are presented in the paper "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12610".
In particular, it consists of the following files:

1. simulateSDEwithRP.nb ...  Wolfram Notebook file for simulating the solutions to SDEs driven by an additive Rosenblatt process. Resulting trajectories are exported in *.csv format.
2.
